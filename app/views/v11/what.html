    <!-- <h2 id="about">About this service</h2> -->
    <h2 id="about">What we mean by standards</h2>
    <p>This service contains data standards, which we group into 4 categories:</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list-bullet">
<li><strong>electronic records</strong> define what information to collect and how to format it, for example when registering a new patient
<br><br><a href="#">Browse electronic records</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>data dictionaries</strong> define the format of data items so they can be consistently represented, for example names of medications. Reference sets and controlled lists and also included.
<br><br><a href="#">Browse data dictionaries</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>technical specifications</strong> specify how to make information available technically including how the data is structured and transported
<br><br><a href="#">Browse technical specifications</a>.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>data handling</strong> are legal or best practice guidelines on how information should be handled
<br><br><a href="#">Browse data handling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not every standard that exists is listed in this service. You can <a href="about">find out which standards are included</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="who">Benefits of using standards</h2>
    <p>There are many benefits to using data standards including:</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list-bullet">
  <li>itâ€™s more efficient to reuse existing approaches to recording or exchanging data than creating new ones</li>
  <li>it promotes quality by ensuring all care settings are aligned to standards that have been approved by qualified bodies</li>
  <li>it makes it easier to analyse data at the national level and see trends or problems if the data has all been standardised</li>
<li>it is essential to achieving interoperability in England which would allow IT systems across the country to share data - an example of this would be hospitals updating GP records directly using their own systems instead of sending emails or faxes</li>
  </ul>



      <!--  -->
      <h2 id="covered">Report a gap in standards</h2>
      <p>Work is underway to publish a process for people developing new data standards.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, please notify us of plans to create new standards by emailing <a href="mailto:england.interop.standards@nhs.net">england.interop.standards@nhs.net</a>. Local standards that apply at the national level may be uplifted for national use.</p>
